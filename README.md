1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?

Ans: var: Function-scoped, can be re-assigned and re-declared.

let: Block-scoped, can be re-assigned but not re-declared.

const: Block-scoped, cannot be re-assigned or re-declared.


2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?

Ans: map() creates a new array by transforming each item in the original array.

forEach() iterates through an array to perform an action on each item. It doesn't create a new array and returns undefined.

filter() creates a new array with only the items from the original array that pass a specific condition.


3) What are arrow functions in ES6?

Ans: Arrow functions are a new way to write anonymous functions in JavaScript (ES6) that provide a shorter syntax and handle the this keyword differently from regular functions.


4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?

Ans: Destructuring assignment is an ES6 feature that allows me to extract values from arrays or properties from objects and assign them to new, distinct variables in a single, concise statement.


5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?

Ans: Template literals are a cleaner way to create strings in ES6 using backticks (``), which allow me to embed variables and expressions directly inside the string. This is a significant improvement over traditional string concatenation, which requires me to combine multiple strings and variables using the plus (+) sign.
